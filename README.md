Exercise from Deitel's "Java: How to Program" 10th edition

"Write a Java app that prompts for the person's information, instantiates an object of class HeartRates and prints the information from that object -
including the person's first name, last name and date of birth - then calculates and prints the person's age in (years), maximum heart rate,
and target-heart-rate range."
